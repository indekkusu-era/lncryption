The wish was granted.

...It was all an illusion. The image switched to the unfamiliar place with familiar equipments I used to befriend with. What I could see was the colors, as usual, but something was empty inside... It was missing but even the most brilliant mind couldn't specify what was it. 

Everything was happened in a flash of an eye. The memories were all turned into a dust. All I remembered was I was staying right here and right now, as a piece of meat lying around in the spatial dimensions. Without any consciousness, I felt the infinite degree of freedom as I didn't need to deal with any past memories or the environment around me. It was the time I lied down on my work space again... Encountering the same fate at the different time and different state.

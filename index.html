    <h2 id="unknown1">It was an exhausting day... thinking about the future only increases my exhaustion.</h2>
    <h2 id="unknown2">So much beauty surrounded me in this world... if only I could escape to reach it.</h2>
    <h2 id="unknown3">Why bother trying to be someone when I struggle to feel like myself?</h2>
    <h2 id="unknown4">I could not believe what I saw in front of me...</h2>
    <h2 id="unknown5">The outside world was going so fast that I lost all sense of time... I guess I have to just follow the flow.</h2>
    <h2 id="unknown6">It grew more chaotic and desynced... I didn't know what was happening but I tried to predict what would happen next.</h2>
    <h2 id="unknown7">I found the point where everything started... It was simple, yet too complicated for a human mind.</h2>
    <h2 id="unknown8">After the countless thoughts, it was not too late to turn back.</h2>
    <h2 id="unknown9">I saw the reflection of myself... I had a motivation to move forward.</h2>
    <h2 id="unknown10">I felt all versions of myself at the same point in time...</h2>
    <h2 id="unknown11">I withstood trials and perils to find inner peace... that's when I found peace out of the boundaries in my mind.</h2>

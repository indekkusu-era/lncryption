                The one night I went sleepless, I started to wonder what I had gotten myself into. Everything felt like a horrible mess and every night I would worry about the immediate future, as the weight of the power clamped on me and the work piled up. 
    
                Though, I decided to wait. Wait for the daytime to arrive. I sat down along the cloths of my curtains, drawing them open and close as the refraction of sunlight beat through the dusty windows and met my eyes. Though they were weak, I instantly felt a strong tug at my heart - the heart was strong, but the mind and body were frail. Nonetheless, it was another day to live.

            <p id="act-1">
                Things started to not make sense to me. I heard things in reverse, and in random greek and latin symbols. The mind seemed to innately know what they meant, but I could not really make clear what the writings on the walls and the sounds around me wanted to imply. 
    
                Now, the ears that used to so kindly hear the souls of the damned were tormented and the frail mind could no longer comprehend. I am singing a duet asynchronously with the rest of the universe.

                Ever wonder what happens when your mind has been pushed to unimaginable pressure and boundaries? Well, your mind and heart start to burn, miraculously, in perfect synchronization. They somehow understand that you're in deep shit, and the will speaks to get out of the predicament.
    
                My body has been set to overdrive mode - I am unable to control the doubly fatigued yet energetic pace I was giving myself, and everything was done in a fit of paroxysm. I could not steer my emotions, neither my mind -- they threatened to move full speed ahead, relentlessly against my body's desire.

            <p id="act-3">
                Walking along the streets, I hear people yelling loudly across them, and the soft whirring of fans. I hear the cries of children, and the woes of the elderly. 
    
                I try to focus on my favourite noodle dish. Yet, I get heavily distracted by these sounds around me. They felt so distracting, yet so harmonious and in sync - it was difficult not to pay attention to them. The mind said no, but the heart felt some instant connection that could not be stopped for the sake of concentration.
    
                For the rest of my day, I lived restlessly, tugging against my shirt and unable to glance down at the work I was supposed to start. I wonder what's gotten into me these days?

                Finally, it was all upon me. The symptoms of mental, emotional and spiritual disconnection from the outside world. I was being encrypted in my own little world, never to leave for as long as I kept myself in.
    
                But what would it take for me to set myself free from eventual death of the heart, soul and mind? 
    
                I stared down into the abyss. There, I saw a streak of water, like the last lifeline of the dehydrated wanderer. Taking out a coin, I tossed it in with empty strokes of my finger. Gripping my trembling hands together, I closed my eyes and prayed, "Please let me leave this dark despair."
    
                "I'm ready to do anything to leave this. Even if it means brutality and death, I will do anything to fulfill my last wish."
